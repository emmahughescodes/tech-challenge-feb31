          <h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Ola Cabs, an India-based transportation app, partnered with AdParlor
            to launch their ride-hailing services into the UK market. With a
            goal to generate cost- efficient App Installs across several UK city
            launches, AdParlor mixed hands-on media management and agile
            creative services to drive success.

          <h2>Creative Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Highlighting Ola’s brand, AdParlor designed customizable ads to
            promote awareness in new markets. Each ad featured adjustable
            elements that were quickly tailored per demographic, geographic
            location, promotion, and holiday via the Creative Blueprints
            technology. Using a variety of different creatives allowed Ola to
            test and discover what creative resonated best with each audience.

        <h2>Media Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          With a thorough understanding of both Ola’s service and audience,
          AdParlor developed a multi-channel, go-to-market strategy for driving
          App Installs. Pairing customized targeting with customized creative,
          Facebook App Install campaigns – along with Google Universal App
          Campaigns and Apple Search – were leveraged to promote demand-side
          installs.
